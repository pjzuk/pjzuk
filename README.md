### Welcome,

my name is Paweł Jan Żuk. I am a physicist. 

This is profile for sharing resources necessary to reproduce results featured in my scientific contributions, which include: \
-> Generalized Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa codes for caluculating hydrodynamic interactions \
-> porousGasificationFoam code for thermal and chemical conversion of porous media \
-> OpenFOAM codes for electrokinetics \
For more details please browse through the repositories.


Currently, I work for two great institutions: \
-> Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences (https://softmatter.ichf.edu.pl/team/pawel-zuk/) \
-> Physics Department, Lancaster University (https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/zuk-pawel)
